# temperatureConverterApp
This file is a temperature converter that takes a given temperature in Farenheit, Celcius, or Kelvin and converts it into an equivalent
temperature in either Farenheit, Celcius, or Kelvin

There are several ways to improve this project, including putting safeguards in to protect against situations where someone tries to convert
from one unit to the same unit.

There is also no data sanitization programmed into this app, which would be highly reccomended if this app were to be used in a public scenario.

The app itself was done for fun, just to get my mind going and to start programming more often.  It was the first python program I composed, despite
being the 2nd program being uploaded into gitHub.  It would be nice to come back and really improve this app, including adding a GUI.
